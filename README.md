## Project Introduction

<p align="justify"><b>IRIS</b> is a decentralized crypto payment solution inspired by Indonesia‚Äôs QRIS system, designed to bring the same level of accessibility, simplicity, and standardization to the world of cryptocurrency. With <b>IRIS</b>, users can scan a single QR code to pay with various cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin and ICP, while merchants receive payments seamlessly, even if they don't have a crypto wallet. For merchants without a wallet, <b>IRIS</b> automatically provisions a secure virtual wallet on the Internet Computer (ICP) network. <b>IRIS</b> also supports real-time fiat-to-crypto conversion, enabling users to pay in one currency and merchants to receive in another. With plans to support cross-chain assets and integrate decentralized exchanges for live conversion rates, <b>IRIS</b> aims to make crypto truly usable for everyday transactions. Just as QRIS empowered millions of merchants across Indonesia, IRIS envisions a world where crypto becomes a practical, trusted, and everyday method of payment, starting one scan at a time.
